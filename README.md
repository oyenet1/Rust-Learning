Learning Rust

- Always use snake case when declaring variable in rust e.g 
```rs 
let my_name = "Bowofade";
```

- All rust code must be inside main function

```rs 
fn main(){
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

- An unused variable should be prepend with underscore

```rs
let _is_tall = false;
```

- to output variable in rust use {variable name} eg
```rs
let age  = 45;
let my_name = "I am Ade"

println!("{:?}, I am  years {age} old", my_name, age)
```
